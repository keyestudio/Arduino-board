# **Keyestudio UNO R3 DEVELOPMENT BOARD**

**![](KS0001/media/2ee4ef34c0458ac0c4e88fdeb7e8940c.jpeg)**

**Introduction:**

Keyestudio UNO R3 development board is a microcontroller board based on the
ATmega328P
([datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc8161.pdf)),
fully compatible with ARDUINO UNO REV3. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of
which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a
USB connection, a power jack, 2 ICSP headers and a reset button.

It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it
to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to
get started.

Note that the two ICSP headers separately used to program the firmware to
ATMEGA16U2-MU and ATMEGA328P-PU, but we have programmed the two chips, so
generally no need to use them.

The Uno R3 differs from all preceding boards in that it does not use the FTDI
USB-to-serial driver chip. Instead, it features the Atmega16U2 programmed as a
USB-to-serial converter.

The UNO is the best board to get started with electronics and coding. If this is
your first experience tinkering with the platform, the UNO is the most robust
board you can start playing with.

It is often called the SPI (serial peripheral interface) and can be considered an "extension" of the output. In fact, slave the output devices under the SPI bus host. When connecting to PC, program the firmware to ATMEGA328P-PU. |

The main IC (integrated circuit) on the Arduino is slightly different from the panel pair. Microcontrollers are usually from ATMEL. Before you load a new program on the Arduino IDE, you must know what IC is on your board. This information can be checked at the top of IC.      |

**Specialized Functions of Some Pins:**

-   **Serial communication:**  Digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX).

-   **PWM Interfaces (Pulse-Width Modulation):** D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11

-   **External Interrupts:** D2 (interrupt 0) and D3 (interrupt 1). These pins
    can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low value, a rising or
    falling edge, or a change in value.

-   **SPI communication:** D10 (SS), D11 (MOSI), D12 (MISO), D13 (SCK). These
    pins support SPI communication using the SPI library.

-   **IIC communication:**  A4 (SDA); A5(SCL)

**Warnings:**

-   The Arduino Uno has a resettable polyfuse that protects your computer's USB
    ports from shorts and overcurrent. If more than 500 mA is applied to the USB
    port, the fuse will automatically break the connection until the short or
    overload is removed.

-   Automatic (Software) Reset:

    Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload,
    the Arduino Uno board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by
    software running on a connected computer.

-   The Uno board contains a trace that can be cut to disable the auto-reset.
    The pads on either side of the trace can be soldered together to re-enable
    it. It's labeled "RESET-EN". You may also be able to disable the auto-reset
    by connecting a 110 ohm resistor from 5V to the reset line; see [this forum
    thread](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,22974.0.html) for details.

**Detailed Use with ARDUINO Software as follows:**

**Step1 \| Download the Arduino environment (IDE)**

When you get the UNO development board, first you should install the Arduino
software and driver.

We usually use the Windows software Arduino 1.5.6 version. You can download it
from the link below:

[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases\#1.5.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases#1.5.x)

Or you can browse the ARDUINO website to download the latest version from this
link, <https://www.arduino.cc>, pop up the following interface.

![](KS0001/media/03bcbac0c292a11cc4969884a260c24e.png)

Then click the **SOFTWARE** on the browse bar, you will have two options ONLINE
TOOLS and DOWNLOADS.

![](KS0001/media/c4beb46eae68ef824353b8cc72a19768.png)

Click **DOWNLOADS**, it will appear the latest software version of ARDUINO 1.8.5
shown as below.

In this software page, on the right side you can see the version of development
software for different operating systems. ARDUINO has a powerful compatibility.
You should download the software that is compatible with the operating system of
your computer.

We will take **WINDOWS system** as an example here. There are also two options
under Windows system, one is installed version, the other is non-installed
version.

For simple installed version, first click **Windows Installer**, you will get
the following page.

**Installing Driver:**

Next, we will introduce the driver installation of UNO R3 development board. The
driver installation may have slight differences in different computer systems.
So in the following let’s move on to the driver installation in the WIN 7
system.

The Arduino folder contains both the Arduino program itself and the drivers that
allow the Arduino to be connected to your computer by a USB cable. Before we
launch the Arduino software, you are going to install the USB drivers.

![](KS0001/media/bd93889abeed8f6b1c70b145de108d7d.png)

Plug one end of your USB cable into the Arduino and the other into a USB socket
on your computer.

When you connect UNO board to your computer at the first time, right click the
icon of your *“Computer” —\>for “Properties”—\> click the “Device manager”*,
under “Other Devices”, you should see an icon for “Unknown device” with a little
yellow warning triangle next to it. This is your Arduino.

![](KS0001/media/27f6de2d3f0125ed978586e8b99b2033.png)

Then right-click on the device and select the top menu option (Update Driver
Software...) shown as the figure below.

![](KS0001/media/8ac7d3085c739ec9c9a89151be325dc9.png)

It will then be prompted to either “Search Automatically for updated driver
software” or “Browse my computer for driver software”. Shown as below. In this
page, select “Browse my computer for driver software”.

![](KS0001/media/31fdd7c7d5c23f2aced927993c8314cd.png)

After that, select the option to browse and navigate to the “drivers” folder of
Arduino installation.

![](KS0001/media/4a638bb3e87737db0a4795418dcf9cf3.jpeg)

Click “Next” and you may get a security warning, if so, allow the software to be
installed. Shown as below.

![](KS0001/media/3b743c92f153068c5417126e25e9ef88.png)

Installation completed, click “Close”.

![](KS0001/media/4ed2b0f5f38a5f9dbd667146f96740e3.png)

Up to now, the driver is installed well. Then you can right click *“Computer”
—\>“Properties”—\>“Device manager”*, you should see the device shown below.

**Step2\| Connect the board**

Connect the UNO board to your computer using the USB cable. The green power LED
should go on.

![](KS0001/media/59ccdc641aef7ad0d202d20db3623982.jpeg)

**Step3\| Select the Arduino Board**

Open the Arduino IDE, you’ll need to click the “Tools”, then select the Board
that corresponds to your Arduino.

![](KS0001/media/5a8c8873c38b42bc15079e87892a8c93.png)

**Step4\| Select your serial port**

Select the serial device of the Arduino board from the **Tools \| Serial Port
menu**. This is likely to be COM3 or higher (COM1and COM2 are usually reserved
for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your Arduino board
and re-open the menu; the entry that disappears should be the Arduino board.
Reconnect the board and select that serial port.

Here you should select COM 3 as below.

![](KS0001/media/c19faf822e9009d065235de63b408960.png)

**Note:** to avoid errors, the COM Port should keep the same as the Ports shown
on Device Manager.

![](KS0001/media/b6a6259722d7d07b8ecb4f92f1862142.png)

**Step5\|Upload the Program**

Below is an example program for displaying the Hello World!

Copy and paste the code to the Arduino environment IDE.

**///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**

    int val;

    int ledpin=13;

    void setup()

    {

    Serial.begin(9600);

    pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT);

    }

    void loop()

    {

    val=Serial.read();

    if(val=='R')

    {

    digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH);

    delay(500);

    digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW);

    delay(500);

    Serial.println("Hello World!");

    }

    }

**///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**

Then click verify button to check the errors. If compiling successfully, the
message "Done compiling." will appear in the status bar.

![](KS0001/media/44e8356462a29eccef8144f812ca640d.png)

After that, click the “Upload” button to upload the code. Wait a few seconds -
you should see the RX and TX leds on the board flashing. If the upload is
successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar. (Note:
If you have an Arduino Mini, NG, or other board, you'll need to physically
present the reset button on the board imKS0001/mediately before pressing the upload
button.)

![](KS0001/media/44e8356462a29eccef8144f812ca640d.png)

**Step6\|Open the Serial Monitor**

After that, click the serial monitor button to open the serial monitor.

![](KS0001/media/3b5e49114b0ba399112a3c63836b8754.png)

Then set the baud rate as 9600, enter an “R” and click Send, you should see the
RX led on the board blink once, and then D13 led blink once, finally "Hello
World!" is showed on the monitor, the TX led blink once.
