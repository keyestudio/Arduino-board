 Introduction

The MEGA control board, among the series of MCUs , is the most popular since it
has numerous pins.

However, a substantial number of pins don’t meet the space demand of DIY design.
To tackle this issue, we roll out the Keyestudio MEGA PRO development board. In
fact, its use method is as same as the official mega board, in addition to the
different volume.

Its processor core is ATMEGA2560-16AU. In the meantime, it has 54 digital
input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4
channel serial communication ports, a USB connection, 1 ICSP header, and a reset
button. And all ports are extended by pins with the interval of 2.54mm.

What’s more, you can burn the firmware for ATMEGA2560-16AU through the built-in
ICSP port. The firmware of this chip is burnt well before delivery, therefore,
you don’t need to burn the firmware.

The power can be supplied through USB cable, port 5V , GND（DC 5V）, as well as
Vin GND (DC 7-12V).

 **4. Windows System**

 **4.1 Download Arduino IDE**

When getting this control board, we need to install Arduino IDE

Enter the website <https://www.arduino.cc/>，and click
![](KS0502/media/6e0a6f98ef8676a190750e098ff76bc2.png)\>![](KS0502/media/547851627850831b48f17aeb3e81d748.png)

![](KS0502/media/556bf0bf1e5124eb63399aeb0ca381d5.png)

You can select the latest version-----1.8.13. Alternatively, the previous
release is your another choice.

In this project, we use 1.8.12 version.

Click![](KS0502/media/47d9dc6547c11049dc424789c22bdfbc.png)to enter the new page. As
shown below;

The **Windows installer** needs installing manually. Yet , the **Windows zip
file for non admin install**，a zip file of Arduino 1.8.12 version, can be
directly downloaded and installed.

**4.2 Install Driver**

For this part, we need to install the driver of Arduino IDE

First, let’s attach USB cable to computer. The driver can be installed
automatically if the PC system is Windows 10, however, you need to install the
driver manually if the PC system is other version.

The USB to serial chip of control board is CH340G, therefore, we will install
its driver(usb_ch341_3.1.2009.06).

Click Computer----- Properties----- Device Manager, as shown below:

![](KS0502/media/c71282321c1496b288d9cbc40048e069.png)

Click ![](KS0502/media/8a28db282ad16fa8b774e5eac645659f.png)and“Update Driver Program”

When downloading the sketch to the board, you must select the correct name of
Arduino board that matches the board connected to your computer. As shown below;

![](KS0502/media/1329e07fd62f8cb94db7bf7a5187f822.png)

Then select the correct COM port (you can see the corresponding COM port after
the driver is successfully installed).

B- Used to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.  
C- Used to create shortcut window of a new sketch.  
D- Used to directly open an example sketch.  
E- Used to save the sketch.  
F- Used to send the serial data received from board to the serial monitor.

 4.4 Start A Program

Open the file to select **Example**, and click **BASIC**\>**BLINK**, as shown
below:
