**![KS0486-2](KS0486/media/c83a871227f81d356fa2fb26a72be147.jpeg)**

## **1.Description**

Doing experiments with electronic products, we often program on the Arduino IDE
development environment with Arduino series microcontrollers.

Keyestudio PLUS control board is fully compatible with Arduino IDE development
environment. It is as same as the Arduino UNO R3 board. Moreover, some
improvements we made highly strengthen its function(as shown below). In order to
wire efficiently, we equip it with a 1m USB cable with type-c interface for you.

## **5. Install Arduino IDE and Driver**

**5.1 Download the Arduino IDE**

When getting this control board, we need to install Arduino IDE.

Enter the website
<https://www.arduino.cc/>，click![](KS0486/media/6e0a6f98ef8676a190750e098ff76bc2.png)and![](KS0486/media/547851627850831b48f17aeb3e81d748.png)

Download the version you want and the latest one is available for downloading
too.

![](KS0486/media/585cbcf64045c22b13ceae74993c686c.png)

Alternatively, you could select previous release.

In this project, we use 1.8.12 version

Click ![](KS0486/media/0538def64a1e0a0738670fa4760d1b1f.png) to download an installer
of Arduino 1.8.12 version，which needs to be installed manually. When you
tap![](KS0486/media/7ad67cbcddb6c5b99226caeb2adfc267.png)，a zip file of Arduino 1.8.12
version will be directly downloaded, and you only need to unzip it to finish the
installation.

Click icon![](KS0486/media/eb38059970cd241208142e24eeef94f9.png) to download Arduino
IDE.

**5.2 Installing Driver**

Let’s install the driver of keyestudio PLUS control board . The USB-TTL chip on
PLUS board adopts CP2102 serial chip. The driver program of CP2102 is included
in Arduino 1.8 version and above, which is convenient to operate. Plugged in
USB, the computer can recognize the hardware and automatically install the
driver of CP2102.

**Note: If the version of Arduino IDE you download is below 1.8, you need to
download the driver of CP2102.**

**Download the driver of CP2102:**

**https://fs.keyestudio.com/CP2102-WIN**

If install unsuccessfully, or you intend to install manually, open the device
manager of computer. Right click Computer----- Properties----- Device Manager.

![](KS0486/media/5d3921d98a5be791b0b5166164b389e7.png)

There is a yellow exclamation mark on the page, which implies an unsuccessful
installation of the driver of CP2102 . Then please double click the hardware and
update the driver.

![](KS0486/media/0946d3e3d322e66303a5e3fec0bb53c0.png)

Click “OK” to enter the following page, click “browse my computer for updated
driver software”, and find the installed or downloaded ARDUINO software. As
shown below:

![](KS0486/media/abff63e491413339a985a0a03df21106.png)

There is a DRIVERS folder in Arduino software installed
package（![](KS0486/media/f50a31a59716594afbd7c2254cfd521e.png)）, open driver folder
and you can see the driver of CP210X series chips.

![](KS0486/media/8e4f9bbf067cdc64fe15f91b276b1cd9.png)

Open device manager, we will find the yellow exclamation mark disappear. The
driver of CP2102 is installed successfully.

To avoid the errors when uploading the program to the board, you need to select
the correct Arduino board that matches the board connected to your computer.

Then come back to the Arduino software, you should click Tools→Board, to select
the board. (as shown below)
