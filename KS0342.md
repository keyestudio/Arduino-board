 Introduction:

Keyestudio MEGA compatible board Advanced is a microcontroller board based on
the
[ATMEGA2560-16AU](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf)
, fully compatible with [Keyestudio MEGA R3
board](http://wiki.keyestudio.com/index.php/Ks0002_keyestudio_Mega_2560_R3_Development_Board)
and ARDUINO MEGA REV3.

It has 54 digital input/output pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16
analog inputs, 4 UARTs (hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a
USB connection, a power jack, 2 ICSP headers, and a reset button.

It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller. With its
bootloader, program can be downloaded directly with USB and you don’t need to
use other external programmer.

Just simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it via an
external DC power jack (DC 7-12V) or via female headers Vin /GND (DC 7-12V) to
get started.

**Note:** the most important difference between keyestudio MEGA compatible board
Advanced and keyestudio MEGA R3 board is the voltage regulator chip used in the
board.

The voltage regulator chip used in keyestudio MEGA R3 board is NSP1117. When
connect the external power, output 5V, the drive current is 1A.

However, keyestudio MEGA compatible board Advanced features the
voltage-regulator chip MP2307DN. When connect the external power, output 5V, the
drive current can be 2A.

The MEGA is designed for more complex projects. With 54 digital I/O pins, 16
analog inputs and a larger space for your sketch, it is the recommended board
for 3D printers and robotics projects. This gives your projects plenty of room
and opportunities.

 Specialized Functions of Some Pins:

-   **Serial Communication:** D0 (RX0) and D1 (TX1); Serial 1: D19 (RX1) and D18
    (TX1); Serial 2: D17 (RX2) and D16 (TX2); Serial 3: D15 (RX3) and D14 (TX3).

    Used to receive (RX) and transmit (TX) TTL serial data. Pins 0 and 1 are
    also connected to the corresponding pins of the ATmega16U2 USB-to-TTL Serial
    chip.

-   **PWM Pins (Pulse-Width Modulation):** D2 to D13, and D44 to D46.

Provide 8-bit PWM output with the
[analogWrite()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/analog-io/analogwrite/)
function.

-   **External Interrupts:** D2 (interrupt 0), D3 (interrupt 1), D18 (interrupt
    5), D19 (interrupt 4), D20 (interrupt 3), and D21 (interrupt 2).

    These pins can be configured to trigger an interrupt on a low level, a
    rising or falling edge, or a change in level. See the
    [attachInterrupt()](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/)
    function for details.

-   **SPI communication:** D53 (SS), D52 (SCK), D51 (MOSI), D50 (MISO).

    These pins support SPI communication using the[SPI
    library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI). The SPI pins are also
    broken out on the ICSP header, which is physically compatible with the
    Arduino Uno.

-   **IIC communication:** D20 (SDA); D21 (SCL). Support TWI communication using
    the [Wire library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire).

 Tips:

-   Automatic (Software) Reset:

    Rather than requiring a physical press of the reset button before an upload,
    the MEGA board is designed in a way that allows it to be reset by software
    running on a connected computer.

-   The MEGA board contains a trace that can be cut to disable the auto-reset.
    The pads on either side of the trace can be soldered together to re-enable
    it. It's labeled "RESET-EN". You may also be able to disable the auto-reset
    by connecting a 110 ohm resistor from 5V to the reset line; see [this forum
    thread](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,22974.0.html) for details.

 Detailed Use with ARDUINO Software as follows:

 Step1\| Download the Arduino environment (IDE)

When you get the MEGA development board, first you should install the Arduino
software and driver.

We usually use the Windows software Arduino 1.5.6 version. You can download it
from the link below:

[https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases\1.5.x](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/OldSoftwareReleases1.5.x)

Or you can browse the ARDUINO website to download the latest version from this
link, <https://www.arduino.cc>, pop up the following interface.

**Installing Driver:**

Next, we will introduce the driver installation of MEGA development board. The
driver installation may have slight differences in different computer systems.
So in the following let’s move on to the driver installation in the WIN 7
system.

The Arduino folder contains both the Arduino program itself and the drivers that
allow the Arduino to be connected to your computer by a USB cable. Before we
launch the Arduino software, you are going to install the USB drivers.

 Step2\| Connect the board

Connect the MEGA board to your computer using the USB cable. The power LED
should go on.

![](KS0342/media/b34b4ad4eed49c3e90b18f3cb28550c4.jpeg)

 Step3\| Select the Arduino Board

Open the Arduino IDE, you’ll need to click the “Tools”, then select the Board
that corresponds to your Arduino.

![](KS0342/media/6a745365356c7da561cb40210623667f.png)

 Step4\| Select your serial port

Select the serial device of the Arduino board from the **Tools \| Serial Port
menu**. This is likely to be COM3 or higher (COM1and COM2 are usually reserved
for hardware serial ports). To find out, you can disconnect your Arduino board
and re-open the menu; the entry that disappears should be the Arduino board.
Reconnect the board and select that serial port.

![](KS0342/media/bf826c3897ff2e390def91f17025b1dd.png)

**Note:** to avoid errors, the COM Port should keep the same as the Ports shown
on Device Manager.

 Step5\| Upload the Program

Below is an example program for displaying the Hello World!

Copy and paste the code to the Arduino environment IDE.

**///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**

int val;//define variable val

int ledpin=13;// define digital pin13

void setup()

{

Serial.begin(9600);// set the baud rate at 9600. When connected to a specific
device, (e.g. bluetooth), the baud rate needs to be the same with the device.

pinMode(ledpin,OUTPUT);// initialize digital pin 13 as output. When using I/O
ports on an Arduino, this kind of set up is always needed.

}

void loop()

{

val=Serial.read();// read the instruction or character from PC to Arduino, and
assign them to Val.

if(val=='R')// determine if the instruction or character received is an “R”.

{ // if it’s “R”,

digitalWrite(ledpin,HIGH);// set the LED on digital pin 13 on.

delay(500);

digitalWrite(ledpin,LOW);// set the LED on digital pin 13 off.

delay(500);

Serial.println("Hello World!");// display“Hello World！”.

}

}

**///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////**

Then click verify button to check the errors. If compiling successfully, the
message "Done compiling." will appear in the status bar.

![](KS0342/media/6eb09bd39590c86974dce3780f5f147d.png)

After that, click the “Upload” button to upload the code. Wait a few seconds -
you should see the RX and TX leds on the board flashing. If the upload is
successful, the message "Done uploading." will appear in the status bar.

![](KS0342/media/35b07d987c2d411e32abfa08b944c8c7.png)

 Step6\| Open the Serial Monitor

After that, click the serial monitor button to open the serial monitor.

![](KS0342/media/3b5e49114b0ba399112a3c63836b8754.png)

Then set the baud rate as 9600, enter an “R” and click Send, you should see the
TX led on the board blink once, and then D13 led blink once, finally "Hello
World!" is showed on the monitor, the RX led blink once.
